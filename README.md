# WasteLink-IEEE_METU_Pixery_Hackathon

The objective was to create a mobile app project with augmented reality, machine learning, computer vision ,video processing and image editing subjects. Our project has been choosen as the best one among the projects of 10 other participating teams by a jury of four. We created an app using augmented reality with Vuforia to clean the event grounds by making people collect the trashes they had thrown after events such as concerts and expositions. First, the organizers will create an “event” using our app and after that participants in the event grounds will collect and throw trashes at shown bins to gain points. At the end of the event, the person who has gotten the highest score by collecting trashes will be given a reward determined by the organizers.
